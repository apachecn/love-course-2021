這 kan，OK， there now we're alive， this is like bring that out， you what do you find passionate。

 not hustling， how many fun， what do you find passionate， what are you passionate about。

 I gotta be honest with you， yes， what I find really， what I'm really passionate， I'm afraid， yes。

 that's， please， please， let's try to be funny， one day， I will look into the mirror。

 and I'll see myself， so good， so proud， like huge， how describe it， describe， the details。

I'm gonna be so ripped，I'm gonna have veins all over my stomach，I'm sorry， fucked up。

I'm not gonna have， sell to the crowd， just bring in the crowd， even louder。

 if you are more passionate， you'd be so fucking loud，7 fucking cars， alright。

 now if you all do a little different， for you， it's like here we kinda tapped in that passion。

 for you， amp it up even more， so think right now， you're delivering Shakespeare on fucking stage。

 it's like this is， you're preaching， right now it's like， just like， you're fucking preaching。

 I want a full range， I want loud and quiet， I want fast and slow。

 you know it's like when I'm talking， if I was like， you're still good， but still kind of stiff。

 it's like， and again you're in front of a crowd， but if I was like， so everyone， with abundance。

 what I really want， and it's like， it's cool， it's better than， oh so it's all that's abundance。

 it's like yeah it's cool， but it's not like that same， it doesn't fucking bring people in。

 like I want that， it's like， add the emotion， like I want real passion。

 because that doesn't feel like real passion， it's like if that's not it。

 it's like what turns you onto the point， it's like， real admit， that's what I want， like a life。

 whatever it is， it's not the thing， what makes you feel alive， if it's nothing。

 this is something everyone should think about， because if you don't know what turns you on。

 good luck， dumb it down anything， just fucking add that passion， so， think it's like this。

 when I have like， my air is day， like I'm on a university， I'm studying， I'm studying my shit。

 I feel bored out of my mind dude， is this so boring， make us interested， make people like。

 you should see people's faces light up too， come on， a lie， when I go train， after that fucking day。

 I feel so fulfilled， look at the crowd， yeah， I feel so fulfilled when I。

 when I go punch that fucking back， like， zone in in detail， because like。

 it's a tendency to keep it very general， it's like you feel fulfilled， cool， what exactly。

 and just keep talking about how fulfilled， and in which ways you are fulfilled。

 keep reinforcing that， go， do it， shit， think it's like this， shake spear， fucking back。

 to the crowd， to the crowd， reel them in， yeah， I do my shit， like it's so good。

 I'm looking at myself in a mirror， and I see that fucking bunch coming through， and I see it。

 it's the， the bare impact of my fucking fist going through， it's so good。

 make it the best speech anyone's ever heard， this should be like， present like。

 presentential speech， don't imitate Donald Trump or Hillary， not Donald Trump or Hillary， better。

 better， like， you should be like， imagine like right now I give you， 20 seconds to live。

 these are the last， 20 seconds， where you can express yourself， and share yourself with everyone。

 the last 20 seconds， make him count， I'm counting， 20， 19， 18， 17， the zit。

 that you didn't do shit with your life， what did you do， you didn't accomplish anything。

 you didn't leave your passions， you should go out and do fucking shit。

 you should go out and do whatever fucking is， you should go study， go train， pick up girls， hi。

 pause， pause， like， this is really your last dying words， not the words。

 but like where's the passion， dude， if you were going to die， you'd be like。

 I'd throw myself in the fucking forest， it's going to be like， what I'd be like， I'd go all out。

 go all out， didn't happen， loose man， fucking let it out， come on， go， go， right now， bring it。

 reel him in， don't look at me， look at them and just bring it， this is it， your only chance。

 after this was switching to her， you'll never have this chance again， reel him in。

 you have 10 seconds， starting now， stop， that's your fucking ego， in your mind， getting it away。

 I don't want this， you're not， it's hard， talk about it， talk about what's so hard about doing it。

 talk about that， right now it's like the most passionate thing， that's on your mind。

 it's probably how you can't do this， talk about that， don't tell me， tell them， it's so difficult。

 how， don't know what you're looking for， you're fucking going to grasp the， you want to。

 you want to have that thing， that you're looking for， you can't， talk about how you're pushing out。

 I don't want this fight， like the little people are pushing， it's like no that's like。

 you're going to your stories， talk about you're pushing out right now， talk about frustration。

 aren't you frustrated， you can't let loose right now， I'm so frustrated。

 yeah well you don't look it， no it's like， I don't have it， talk about that， talk about that。

 like talk about that， whatever you're feeling， harness that， if you're frustrated。

 you should be like， fuck guys， I just keep like， god damn it， I can't do it like， instead of， okay。

 or going to like， classic stories， I'm so passionate about to talk about it， I'm。

 I'm a desperate looking for it， but I didn't find it yet， I just， keep more personal。

 don't go into stories， keep more personal， just narrate what you feel， harness it。

 I always knew that I'm special， I always knew that I'm special。

 I always knew that there is something， out there for me， but I haven't found it yet。

 it's freaking me to fuck out， it's freaking me to fuck out guys， seriously， and。

 I'm gonna find the one thing， I can't tell you for fuck， a shirt， I'm gonna find the one thing。

 you can find it now， if you let loose， and you finally stop， keeping yourself caged in man。

 that's what I'm saying， it's like you're in that hustle， like， no， no， I'm trying to force it。

 you can't force it， it's like just at some point， fuck it， fuck it， fuck that front。

 and notice that you just keep going， those same narratives， talking about passion。

 talking about hustle， fuck the narratives， disrupt the patterns， bring some realness out， like。

 if I were you dude， like honestly right now， like what I'd be feeling is， shit I can't bring it out。

 fuck why can't I bring it out， I'd talk about that， versus I'm gonna find the passion people。

 fuck that shit， that's like some dumb story you're saying， I want realness， I want authenticity。

 we'll talk about that shit， don't tell them what they want to hear。

 tell them what you're actually feeling， if you're confused， harness that， talk about the confusion。

 it's really difficult， because not it is like that， I'll stop you there man， like， like， like， like。

 like， man， when you don't want to say it to you， and you will never find what you want to say。

 and you will say it to you， that you will never find， what you want to lie， the meaning of your lie。

 I have a passion about it， think about that， honestly， you will never find。

 and you will die tomorrow， well let's bring it out， let's bring it out with a couple of sizes。

 like what I will say is like， this should be like， like I， if I were you， would be like。

 so pissed on myself right now， it's insane， you don't look pissed at all， I'd be like。

 honestly like， you're here， you have this opportunity to express yourself。

 and you fuck it up like a little pussy， you don't even try， it's not even fucking it up。

 try it's you， pussy it out， and honestly like， this is the most， disappointing shit I've ever seen。

 and like I don't even know what to do， it's like， I'm disgusted by it， straight up disgusted。

 and again， does that make you feel like， smiling， no it's like， be disgusted， aren't you disgusted。

 like what do you feel right now， I feel like I， still have a smile， you still have to buy it。

 yeah you're still hooked on that story， drop that story dude， like the fact that right now。

 like I'm like， you're I'm disgusted， and it does nothing to you， you're just like。

 but I got to find it， I got to find it， what the fuck， are you like， so lost， you're just in。

 lost touch with reality， I got to find it， like if you walk down the street。

 and someone gets hit by a car， and dies， is that gonna， you're gonna feel something。

 or you'd be like， I got to find it， I got to find it， I must find it， oh dead person。

 I must find it， get out of your head man， get out of your head， man， get out of your head man。

 okay now obviously， I'm not disgusted， like I'm saying this to provoke shit。

 and the fact that it's not provoking shit， that should be the warning bit。

 like you got to get in your body man， got to bring some fucking authenticity， I see this fake front。

 this constructed fake front， I'm gonna find it， no one's gonna be pissing you for finding it。

 I'm so perfect， I'm chasing my passion， is anyone not like chasing passion， is anyone against that。

 everyone approves of me， and someday I will find it， is anyone against that， finding it someday。

 no no， okay， fuck that， dude， fuck this narrative， realness， authenticity， tell them what you feel。

 stop trying to be so perfect and cool， if you feel frustrated， if you feel sad。

 if you feel like fuck， why can't I do it？， harness that， what do you feel right now？。

 I got to find it， I'm sure it， what do you feel？， I feel like a mixture of feelings。

 I feel like someday， you're gonna find it， I feel like someday， someday I have fun， someday。

 I feel like I'm spinning circle， I can guarantee you this， like you want so well to do right。

 and so does everyone， it's like we're trying so well to do right， be right do right。

 if I do everything right， people will like me， people are craving authenticity。

 it's not about right or like wrong， it's like they want authenticity， we crave it。

 there was a guy last， was it last week， yeah it was last week in Amsterdam。

 he had a different kind of constructed front， you have the very self-help junkie front。

 he had the class clown front， who was that Amsterdam？， you remember the guy。

 he's like he's like kind of class clowny， kind of like some people here， like bring me up。

 bring me up， and it's like yeah he puts on the front， he's like hi everyone。

 yeah I'm in front of the stage， it's good， it's a very well-crafted front， now I'm kind of a dick。

 and I use my game skills for this， to kind of pierce through that， I pretty much do the same thing。

 am I dude， this shit's discussing， I never hang out with you， he's like how the。

 why are you laughing， like loose until， it broke down， and he didn't have a choice。

 he's like yeah I kind of don't feel good， and then we brought him back up， but like that glimpse。

 of even him admitting， you know I kind of feel stupid， and yeah it is a front。

 connected with fucking everyone， and everyone right now， that's why they're on your side。

 they don't care， it's like what you say， they just want to see， it's like， wake that shit in them。

 it's like let's see some realness， that's all they want， it's not about the front。

 it's not about the right， it's like where's the authenticity， what's actually going on， that's it。

 that's what turns people on， and stop buying into this， little lies， like I'm going to find it。

 like fuck that little， programming shit， what's real， and that's what's also。

 blocking you from going deep， like what happens if I don't do it， hope I'm going to find it。

 I'm going to find it， what's real， start being honest with yourself， until you do that too。

 you're never going to really， like yourself， because you never are， or this with yourself。

 what do you get， I'm going to find it， everyone， what do you get， what do you get， please， please。

 please， what do you get， I get it， I'm fucked up， no you're not， just stop trying。

 just let people see you， what are you afraid they're going to see。

 what are you afraid people are going to see， if you stop， telling them you're going to find it。

 what's so bad about that， now， just this pause， pause pause， pause pause， pause， pause， pause。

 pause， pause， pause， pause， pause，以前你覺得，所有人都 feel like this，我本來已經知道，但那是，呢，那是 donde you wanna find。
