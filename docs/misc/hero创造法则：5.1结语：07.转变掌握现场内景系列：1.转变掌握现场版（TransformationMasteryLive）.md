# hero创造法则：5.1结语：07.转变掌握现场内景系列：1.转变掌握现场版（ Transformation Mastery Live）

所以我 thought I'd add a last section， with some broken down transformational infield footage。

 which is broken down footage， that was filmed with audience members during my live event。

 transformation mastery live， and what I did here is I selected some of my favorite segments from this event。

 each focusing on and illustrating a specific point， a specific aspect if you will。

 and I've broken them down for you in extreme detail。

 in order to provide you with concrete real life examples， of everything that we've discussed so far。

 okay you're going to see everything that we talked about here in the following videos。

 in action with people just like you and me， and this will really help add more context to this information。

 and help cement it as well， okay that's my big goal with this section。

 and I also want to introduce here the outer approach， and this is huge okay so。

 so far there's been a big focus on the inner approach， that is how you get to the cause。

 okay remember this is primarily an inner journey， you cannot get to the cause externally。

 however this does not mean that you can't also use， an outer approach to your advantage。

 okay as long as you don't confuse this outer approach with getting to the cause。

 you can still use it as an extra tool or an extra stepping stone if you will。

 and you can hit it from both angles internally， but also externally。

 and this is a big part of this event where， you know if you think of it like this。

 take someone who's extremely introverted or shy， just very stifled and reserved。

 most likely that person was shamed during their upbringing。

 you know they were shamed for being loud， putting themselves out there， expressing who they are。

 someone told them hey no no no no， don't talk back don't be loud， don't take up so much space。

 don't extend your behavior past this certain point here， stay shy stay introverted。

 and in order to cope you took on this front of just been very quiet all the time。

 now this doesn't mean as a little sign of that you can't be quiet or reserved。

 at times you know it all depends on the place it's coming from。

 are you doing it out of inspiration or desperation。

 and someone who's always stifled and quiet and reserved。

 I can guarantee you there are a lot of times where it's out of desperation。

 or it wouldn't be so compulsive， so for that person getting to the cause。

 and this is the inner approach would be going back， and letting go you know of all of those times。

 they were shamed letting go of all that resistance， to putting themselves out there。

 however you can also use the outer approach by for example， practicing screaming。

 practicing extending your behavior past that certain point。

 by doing something like this you know screaming for example。

 although it doesn't get to the cause what it does do for someone who's extremely shy。

 introverted and reserved all the time， is that it gives them one a reference of nothing that happening。

 and this is big because the fear that we have is， oh my god if I stop being introverted。

 if I extend my behavior little too much， I will die， it's irrational but that's the fear we have。

 it's that fear of death， and what you do here especially when it's a huge crowd。

 is you've proved yourself that you didn't die， you proved yourself that。

 hmm maybe it wasn't that bad， maybe it wasn't all of that unacceptable after all。

 and the other thing that it does is， it gives you a reference reminding you what it feels like to be authentic。

 and that's the biggest one， you know you hear there's that expression， fake it till you make it。

 and reality is act real until you remember， it's not fake until you make it。

 it's act real until you remember， because fake it till you make it。

 what it implies is you are real right now， you know that person who is shy， introverted reserved。

 that's them being real， and them being loud， you know being more extroverted。

 that is them faking it， but that's not true， okay， them being fake。

 is them being introverted all the time， it's them being reserved all the time。

 that's not them being real， that's them being fake， that's them putting on this front。

 this personality that they developed early on， in order to cope with。

 the fact that it you know it was not acceptable to be very loud， and you know this household。

 it's not acceptable to be extroverted in this household， so to cope they put on this front。

 have been introverted， and they've been putting it on and， buying into it and investing in it。

 for so long they've convinced themselves that is real， they've convinced themselves。

 me being real is me being introverted， wrong， okay， right now what you think is real is fake。

 and you faking it till you make it， in reality is you acting real again。

 reminding yourself what be not authentic， feels like， this side is going to yell first。

 then this side， and you guys have to yell louder than this side。

 then this side again louder louder louder， louder， and all directed， and when I do the final yell。

 for like five to ten seconds， when everyone together， just go as loud as you faking can。

 whatever you feel like putting your arms up， you feel like jumping up and down。

 as long as it's not ruining the room， it's loud as you faking can， and mainly with this。

 notice what happens in your head， notice how， it takes sometimes some effort to get there。

 but once you pierce through， it is effortless， it is permanent， it just comes flowing to fuck out。

 because you finally got out of your own way， okay， so， let's start with this side， loud as you can。

 321， you， you， you， everyone pause， you're going to yell， now notice this。

 I can always see it by the way， how alive or how someone is in their head。

 just by the way they look， everyone's like going for it， very much in your head。

 now based on how much in your head， I'm actually nervous pointing you out。

 because most likely you're going to， send your head and it was like， fuck you， like that。

 but let's hope for the opposite， I'll do anything， just be real， at least a smile。

 let's try solo one yell， join in， get out of your head， join in， 321， 321， 321， 321， 321， now pause。

 now you're not doing it for me， remember you're not doing it for me， you're doing it for you。

 and there's little glimpses， when people start screaming， you're like， good enough， good enough。

 fuck the good enough， like that's again， it's like right now， trust me， this sucks， and is scarier。

 than anything， like people experience this， when they have to sing in front of people， you're like。

 oh， but if you just like surrender， like just stop trying so hard。

 like because they require so much effort， and that's one question you should all ask yourself。

 like aren't you sick， and fucking tired of just trying so hard， are you tired of it。

 of just maintaining this front， of just like， trying to be cool， and trying to be right。

 like aren't you just fucking tired， like this here will provide you， temporarily that release。

 and get you back in touch with what the goal is， and trust me， if this environment will do it。

 you'll be in this life of， no no no no no no no no， all the time， just give it a chance。

 just for now， just do it solo， and we can even go back and forth， without cheating， ahh， ahh， ahh。

 ahh， whatever it takes， like， fucking man， ahh， ahh， I want that light， you have a bit of it。

 but then you're holding it back， you're like， all out， like this it， the last scream you'll ever do。

 is loud as you fucking can， like arms up， body in， everything， three two one after me， ahh， ahh。

 ahh， better， now， try doing this with the whole crowd， and just even topping yourself。

 I want to see that light， and for anyone who's like， resist to get like， ahh， I'm too cool。

 I'm too cool， fuck that shit， that's not cool， ahh， this side， everyone， ahh， ahh， ahh， ahh， ahh。

 breathe out， ahh， ahh， ahh， ahh， ahh， ahh， so that's really the goal， of the outer approach here。

 it's getting a reference， that nothing bad happened， and reminding you， what authenticity。

 feels like， it doesn't get to the cause， but it's a good， stepping stone， there， okay。

 and this gets really intense， as little， side notes， as you'll see in the following， videos。

 the exercises we do， during this event， you know， it's not those exercises。

 where you're just writing， down goals for example， it's intense， you know， it's like those fears。

 that you have， that's what you have to， like kind of， plow through， and it's great， because I mean。

 I'm there， so I can help direct you， and I'll break this down， you'll see me， I'll correct people。

 through layers， and layers of resistance， in order to find， what's too， like go of。

 or in order to really， get some intense， experiences， reminding themselves， of who they are。

 and having the crowd， there helps as well， you know， where if you get a reference， of nothing bad。

 and there's a lot of people， it's extremely powerful， and you can use the crowd， as a support group。

 when it gets really， fucking scary， like say， you know， you're there， and you're diving。

 just having a huge crowd， to support you helps， and also， you can use the crowd。

 to put a little bit， of pressure on you， you know， if you're someone who's， like very shy。

 and quiet， I may make you come， you know， in front and sing， and that can be extremely， scary。

 but when you're there， in front of the crowd， I'm there， so there's some authority， like okay， sing。

 there's the huge crowd， and everyone's like， you better do it， it kind of overrides， your ego。

 you're like oh my god， I don't have a choice， you more， and you just like。

 putting yourself out there， so it's really good， to kind of just， push you over the edge， and yeah。

 me this is what， we're going to crack into here， I hope you're ready， and as a little sign-o-2。
